# PacificHoldEmCalculator

This is a utility tool to calculate the odds of your hand winning in the BCLC game [Pacific Hold'Em Poker](https://lotto.bclc.com/pacific-holdem-poker.html), based on the cards left in the deck.

To play this game, you buy a hand at the lotto machine for $2, and you get given a hand of two cards. These cards are not unique to the other hands bought across the province, but they cannot appear on the board when the draw happens.

To win this game, the 2 cards you have must beat the 4 computers on the screen, using the traditional texas hold'em hands. If you beat the 4 computers, you get to split the prize pool with all the other winning tickets in the province. If you think that you have a good ticket, you can raise your ticket in increments of $2, meaning that your ticket now counts as (total cost/$2) tickets. If you raise your ticket to 10$, the max value, and it wins, your ticket can count as 5 tickets.

This brought a realization to me that if I bought enough hands for each draw, I could theoretically figure out what 13 cards are going to come up on the board (5 cards), and in the 4 computer's hands (8 cards). If I know what the 13 cards are, and I do some calculations based on the pairs of cards I have, it is possible I can figure out which of my hands are the best, and I can raise the hand(s) to the max bet.
