# PacificHoldEmCalculator

This is a utility tool to calculate the odds of your hand winning in the BCLC game [Pacific Hold'Em Poker](https://lotto.bclc.com/pacific-holdem-poker.html), based on the cards left in the deck.

To play this game, you buy a hand at the lotto machine for $2, and you get given a hand of two cards. These cards are not unique to the other hands bought across the province, but they cannot appear on the board when the draw happens. 

This brought a realization to me that if I bought enough hands for each draw, I could theoretically figure out what 13 cards are going to come up on the board (5 cards), and in the 4 computer's hand (8 cards). If I know what the 13 cards are, and I do some calculations based on the pairs of cards I have, it is possible I can figure out which of my hands are the best, and I can raise the hand(s) to the max bet.
